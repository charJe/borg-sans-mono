Droid Sans Mono Slashed + Hasklig-style ligatures!

## Overview

I enjoy the ligatures in fonts like [Hasklig] and [Monoid], but I don't much like the design of the fonts themselves, so I thought I'd add similar ligatures to a nicer font. I would have chosen [Consolas] (my preferred programming font), but it's not open-source, so I've gone with [Droid Sans Mono][Droid Sans Mono] (or, more precisely, with the [nice modification with a slashed zero][DroidSlashed] from [cosmix.org]).
